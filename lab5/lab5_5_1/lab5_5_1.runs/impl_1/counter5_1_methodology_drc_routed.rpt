2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-12#1 Warning
DSP input not registered  
DSP instance plusOp is not fully pipelined on the input side. AREG/BREG/CREG/DREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance minusOp.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_5_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin plusOp/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
