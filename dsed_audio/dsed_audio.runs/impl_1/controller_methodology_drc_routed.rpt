2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas and clk_out1_clk_12megas_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas_1 and clk_out1_clk_12megas are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_12megas]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on micro_data relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_12megas 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_12megas 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jack_pwm relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_12megas 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on micro_clk relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_12megas 
Related violations: <none>
